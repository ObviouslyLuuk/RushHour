- Frank Pothâ€™s [video on games in JavaScript](https://youtu.be/w-OKdSHRlfA) was used for the real time engine and general code organization/layout (unrelated to AI).
- I used Chart.js for the line charts tracking the score, and simplebar.js for a pretty scrollbar. Bootstrap was also used for general css.
